### Introduction

Victoria Schwab is an American fantasy and science fiction writer. She debuted her first novel, "The Near Witch" in 2011 and has spent the past 11 years building on this discography. She has published around 39 books, multiple short stories, and has adapted her stories into cinema. Her first TV Show "First Kill", based on her short story by the same name, was released on Netflix in June 2022. As Victoria Schwab's discography increases, new readers of her work need guidance on which books or series to start their Victoria Schwab journey with. This report, which examines data from Seattle Public Library, will look into the popularity of Victoria Schwabs books and series to offer a good starting point to her new audience. 

Specifically, this report analyzes three important questions. The first questions is on which book series of Victoria Schwab's was the most popular, and which month was the most popular for each series? The second question asks which medium is the most popular and how has this changed over the years? Lastly, this report will answer which of Victoria Schwab's books is the most popular in the past year? To answer these questions, the key variables include:

* Library checkouts:
    * The amount of times a book is checked out of the library is used to quantify a particular books popularity. 
* Time
    * What is the trend of checking out Victoria Schwab books or series? In this report, both year and month are used as time frames to inform on the trend of popularity of each book. 
* Books
    * Which books or series hold the highest popularity? Victoria Schwab writes both stand alone novels and book series. This report looks into each book individually as well as books bundled with their series to give new audience members options of which type to begin their journey with. 
* Mediums
    * Which medium is Victoria Schwabs books typically enjoyed using? This variable encompass' physical books, eBooks, audiobooks, and soundisc's. Understanding the medium of engaging with the book will inform a new reader on whick medium they choose to engage the books with themselves. 

### Summary Information

Write a summary paragraph of findings that includes the 5 values calculated from your summary information R script

These will likely be calculated using your DPLYR skills, answering questions such as:

- What is the average number of checkouts for each item?
- What is the month or year with the most/least checkouts for a book that you're interested in?
- What is the month or year with the most/least checkouts for ebooks?
- How has the number of print book checkouts changed over time?

Feel free to calculate and report values that you find relevant.

### The Dataset

- Who collected/published the data?  
- What are the parameters of the data (dates, number of checkouts, kinds of books, etc.)?
- How was the data collected or generated?  
- Why was the data collected?  
- What, if any, ethical questions do you need to consider when working with this data?  
- What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)


### First Trends Over Time Chart

Include a chart. Make sure to describe why you included the chart, and what patterns emerged

The first chart that you will create and include will show the trend over time of your variable/topic/interest. Think carefully about what you want to communicate to your user (you may have to find relevant trends in the dataset first!). Here are some requirements to help guide your design:

- Show more than one, but fewer than ~10 trends
  - For example, two books, or 5 different mediums
- You must have clear x and y axis labels
- The chart needs a clear titleÂ 
- You need a legend for your different line colors and a clear - legend title
In your .Rmd file, make sure to describe why you included the chart, and what patterns emerged

When we say "clear" or "human readable" titles and labels, that means that you should not just display the variable name.

Here's an example of how to run an R script inside an RMarkdown file:

### Second Trends Over Time Chart

Include a chart. Make sure to describe why you included the chart, and what patterns emerged

The second chart that you will create and include will show another trend over time of your variable/topic/interest. Think carefully about what you want to communicate to your user (you may have to find relevant trends in the dataset first!). Here are some requirements to help guide your design:

- Show more than one, but fewer than ~10 trends
  - For example, two books, or 5 different mediums
- You must have clear x and y axis labels
- The chart needs a clear titleÂ 
- You need a legend for your different line colors ?
In your .Rmd file, make sure to describe why you included the chart, and what patterns emerged

When we say "clear" or "human readable" titles and labels, that means that you should not just display the variable name.

### Your Choice

The last chart is up to you. It could be a line plot, scatter plot, histogram, bar plot, stacked bar plot, and more. Here are some requirements to help guide your design:

- You must have clear x and y axis labels
- The chart needs a clear titleÂ 
- You need a legend for your different line colors and a clear legend title
