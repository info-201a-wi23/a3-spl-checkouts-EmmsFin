### The Dataset

This data was collected and published by the Seattle Public Library. There are twelve parameters of the data; if the item is physical or digital (UsageClass), if the item was checked out online or in-person (CheckoutType), the type of item (MaterialType), the year the item was checked out (CheckoutYear), the month the item was checked out (CheckoutMonth), the amount of checkouts for an item (Checkouts), the item title(Title), the items ISBN number (ISBN), the author (Creator), the genre or subject of the item (Subjects), the items publisher (Publisher), and the year of publication (PublicationYear).

The data collection for this dataset began April 2005 and is still continuous with updates occurring monthly. This data was collected by the Seattle Public Library to make predictions for which books will be checked out each month. This helps them keep in use items on the shelf, and move the items that are not being checked out to locations where they will be used. The Open Data Program in the City of Seattle required data generated by the City of Seattle to be public, which is likely why this information is now open to the public.

When interacting with this data set, an ethical question that needs to be considered is privacy and if people consented to this information being made public. Is there any way that a checkout could be tracked to an individual? No matter how encoded a piece of data is, there is often a way that a hacker or a determined individual can determine the owner of a piece of information. Since this is the case, do people consent to their information being shared publicly, and do they know that they are consenting?

There are a few limitations to this data. One limitation is the structure of the data points. For example, authors' names are not spelled consistently throughout the Creator column. For my specific analysis I noticed that Victoria Schwab's name appeared in three different formats on this dataset, "Schwab, Victoria", "Victoria Schwab", and "V. E. Schwab''. When working with this data, I had to filter the Creator column to three variables to create the data frame. This leaves room for an error that is challenging to catch due to the volume of data points in the database. The Creator column is not the only one that is formatted in this way, but the Title column is also written with many different variations for each book. This inconsistency in the data naming makes it extremely challenging to analyze this data. Another limitation in this dataset is that it contains the information for the entirety of Seattleâ€™s Public Libraries without differentiating between branches. The types of analyses that can be performed on this dataset are limited to the entire Seattle area, which reduces the scope of possible analyses and understanding of Seattle's Public Library system.
